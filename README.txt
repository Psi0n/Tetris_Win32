This project is currently about half done.
I wouldn't recommend downloading it for quite some time.

For those interested in the current problem:

The basic Grid/Tetro system I'm using is mostly complete,
but it runs into a problem when it resets a tetro - they
appear at the bottom of the playing field, then move to
the top and work their way down normally.

This would be a realtively minor issue, except for the
fact that it disrupts any tetrominos that have already
been locked in. thus, I'm probably not going to add any
of the missing functionality until the issue is resolved.
